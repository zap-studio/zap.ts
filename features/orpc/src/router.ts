 * How to add a package router:
 *  1. Import the package router exports explicitly (no namespace imports).
 *  2. Add each router to the `router` object below.
 *
 * How to remove a package router:
 *  1. Delete its router imports.
 *  2. Remove its entries from the `router` object.
 *
 * Keep only what you need to reduce type surface & build time.
