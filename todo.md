# TODO

This file serves as a supplement to the official documentation and provides guidance for common customization tasks. In the final release, all information will be integrated into the main documentation.

## Monorepo Architecture

This project follows a purpose-driven, layered architecture designed to scale beyond side projects into production platforms. The structure ensures clean dependency flow, prevents circular dependencies, and maintains clear boundaries between different types of code.

### Directory Structure

```
apps/           # Integration layer - consumers
configs/        # Shared tooling configuration (Next.js, TypeScript, etc.)
packages/       # Agnostic, reusable modules
e2e/           # End-to-end tests
examples/      # Usage examples and reference implementations
```

### Layer Philosophy

#### 1. **apps/** - Integration Layer

Apps are *consumers* that configure and stitch together functionality.

**Responsibilities:**
- Import shared configs from `configs/`
- Import reusable modules from `packages/`
- Compose and configure the final application

**Current apps:**
- `apps/api` - Backend API
- `apps/docs` - Documentation site
- `apps/marketing` - Marketing website
- `apps/storybook` - Component library showcase
- `apps/waitlist` - Waitlist landing page
- `apps/web` - Main web application

#### 2. **configs/** - Tooling Configuration

Lightweight, flexible, and composable configuration packages that provide utilities for different tools.

**Examples:**
- `configs/next` - Shared Next.js configuration
- `configs/playwright` - E2E testing setup
- `configs/tailwind` - Tailwind CSS setup
- `configs/typescript` - TypeScript base configs
- `configs/vitest` - Testing configuration

**Characteristics:**
- Universal and stateless
- Don't depend on `packages/`
- Export composable helper functions (e.g., `withBundleAnalyzer`, `withMDX`)

#### 3. **packages/** - Agnostic Modules

These are fully reusable. Think of them as your internal library ecosystem.

**Examples:**
- `packages/analytics` - Analytics integration
- `packages/async-state` - Asynchronous state management (TanStack Query)
- `packages/config` - Global Zap.ts configuration
- `packages/crypto` - Cryptography utilities
- `packages/errors` - Error handling utilities
- `packages/fonts` - Font utilities
- `packages/pwa` - PWA utilities
- `packages/rpc` - RPC wrapper (oRPC/tRPC)
- `packages/security` - Security utilities
- `packages/seo` - SEO utilities
- `packages/shadcn` - All shadcn/ui components
- `packages/ui` - Shared design system components

**Dependency rules:**
- Can import from `configs/`
- Never import from `apps/`
- These packages are the foundation â€” they don't know about your apps

## Switching Package Managers

This project is configured to use **Bun** by default, but you can easily switch to npm, yarn, or pnpm by updating configuration files.

### 1. Update Turborepo Package Manager

Modify the `packageManager` field in the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "bun@x.x.x"
  // Change to one of:
  // "packageManager": "npm@x.x.x"
  // "packageManager": "yarn@x.x.x"
  // "packageManager": "pnpm@x.x.x"
}
```

### 2. Update GitHub Actions Workflows

Update all workflow files in `.github/workflows/` to use your preferred package manager. Here's an example for the `build.yml` file:

**For Bun (default):**
```yaml
- name: Setup bun
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2 # change the version according to your need

- name: Install dependencies
  run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

- name: Build monorepo
  run: bun run build
```

**For npm:**
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v6 # change the version according to your need
  with:
    node-version: "latest"

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci

- name: Build monorepo
  run: npm run build
```

**For pnpm:**
```yaml
- name: Setup pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4 # change the version according to your need
  with:
    version: "latest"

- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v6 # change the version according to your need
  with:
    node-version: "latest"
    cache: 'pnpm'

- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

- name: Build monorepo
  run: pnpm run build
```

**For yarn:**
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v6 # change the version according to your need
  with:
    node-version: "latest"
    cache: 'yarn'

- name: Install dependencies
  run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

- name: Build monorepo
  run: yarn run build
```

> **Note:** Apply these changes to all workflow files: `build.yml`, `lint.yml`, and `typecheck.yml`.

### 3. Update Dependabot Configuration

Modify the `package-ecosystem` field in `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "bun" # Change to "npm" for npm/yarn/pnpm
    directories:
      - "/"
      - "/apps/marketing"
      - "/apps/app"
      - "/apps/docs"
      - "/packages/ui"
      - # all your packages should be listed
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

> **Important:** Dependabot uses `"npm"` as the ecosystem identifier for npm, yarn, and pnpm. Only use `"bun"` when using Bun.

## Publishing Packages with Changesets

This project includes a pre-configured [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that automatically creates release pull requests when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Current Setup

The release workflow is already configured to:
- Trigger on pushes to the `main` branch
- Create release pull requests based on your changesets
- Track version bumps and changelog updates

### Publishing to npm

The current workflow **does not include a publishing step**. If you want to publish packages to npm, you'll need to:

1. Add an npm token to your GitHub repository secrets
2. Extend the release workflow with a publish step
